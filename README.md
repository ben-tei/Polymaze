# Polymaze

Software Engineering Practice Project

-------------------------------------
Description
-------------------------------------

Polymaze is a mini game that creates and generates random labyrinths. Each user has to, first, create its own account by providing a login and a password.

The registration done, he can now start generating a random labyrinth by indicating its size (length and width). Users have the right to create as many labyrinth as they want.

Once created, if the user finds its labyrinth too complicated and already spends hours trying to resolve it, the program will do the job and give the solution if needed.

If the user finds his labyrinths too easy and already resolved them all, he may try to resolve those created by other users by checking the list of the existing labyrinths.

The generated maze needs to be a “perfect” maze.  A perfect maze means one without any loops or closed circuits, and without any inaccessible areas.

From each point, there is exactly one path to any other point, so the Maze has exactly one solution.
